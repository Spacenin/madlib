The next <noun> is the <noun> of the mature caterpillars, some of which are <adj>. This probably makes the caterpillar even more conspicuous among the green leaves than would otherwise be the case. Let us see, then, whether the habits of the <noun> will throw any light upon the riddle. What would you do if you were a big caterpillar? Why, like most other <adj> creatures, you would feed by night, and lie concealed by day. So do these caterpillars. When the morning light comes, they creep down the stem of the food plant, and lie concealed among the thick herbage and dry sticks and leaves, near the ground, and it is obvious that under such circumstances the <adj> color really becomes a protection. It might indeed be argued that the caterpillars, having become brown, concealed themselves on the ground, and that we were <verb> the state of things. But this is not so, because, while we may say as a general rule that large caterpillars feed by night and lie concealed by day, it is by no means always the case that they are brown; some of them still <verb> the green color. We may then conclude that the habit of concealing themselves by day came first, and that the brown color is a later adaptation.
